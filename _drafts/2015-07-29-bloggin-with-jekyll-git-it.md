### Git it!

####Hey!

Now that we started our jekyll blog, it's time to put it on [Github]

For those of you who don't know what is [Git] and [GitHub], here is a small explanation:

> [Git] is a free and open source distributed version control system designed
> to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

> [GitHub] is a shared web hosting service for projects that uses [Git].
> It's free, but you can upgrade to a paid plan.

You can learn git with [Try git].

Once again, I'll guide you through the processes, and, even if your are nor confortable with the terminal, you can put your blog up.

We need two thing before start:

- a [GitHub] account \(it's free, and it's really good\);
- [Git] installation \([here] is the guide on how to install\).

Now, let's code :D

####Step 1: Create your repository

At your [GitHub] account, create a [repository] with your Github user name;
**Once again, in my case it was [icarcal.github.io]

####Step 2: configure your repo localy

Open the terminal
